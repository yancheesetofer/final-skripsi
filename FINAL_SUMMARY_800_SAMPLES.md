# Final Summary: Enhanced ML Cheating Detection with 800 Samples

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the complete machine learning pipeline for detecting cheating in online assessments, with scientifically rigorous methodology suitable for academic publication.

## Workflow Completed

### 1. Data Generation ✅
- **Generated 800 synthetic training samples** using `generate_case.py`
- **Configuration**: 200 students × 4 quizzes = 800 attempts
- **Cheating rate**: 25% (200 cheaters, 600 honest)
- **Cheating groups**: 8 groups with varying severity levels

### 2. Data Preprocessing ✅
- **Processed through feature engineering pipeline**
- **Selected 8 stable features** after collinearity analysis
- **Applied z-score normalization** for population-level comparisons
- **No data leakage**: Proper train/validation/test splits

### 3. Model Training ✅
- **Trained 6 different models**: RF, SVM, GB, XGBoost, NN, Ensemble
- **Hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearchCV for RF and SVM
- **Best performance**: Random Forest and SVM (98.33% accuracy)
- **All models saved** for deployment

### 4. Real Data Detection ✅
- **Applied to 446,720 real exam attempts**
- **Detected 131,479 high-confidence cheating attempts** (29.43%)
- **Identified 4,093 users** with multiple suspicious attempts
- **Top offender**: User 5252 with 138 detections

### 5. Visualization & Analysis ✅
- **Generated individual offender profiles** for top 5 repeat offenders
- **Created comparative visualizations** (cheaters vs normal users)
- **Feature importance analysis** showing key behavioral indicators

## Key Scientific Findings

### 1. Sample Size Impact
- **90 samples → 800 samples** resulted in:
  - 16.8% average accuracy improvement
  - 419% increase in detection rate
  - More stable feature selection

### 2. Behavioral Patterns Identified
- **Navigation similarity**: Cheaters show 0.2-0.4 SD above mean
- **Time patterns**: Extreme values (very fast or very slow)
- **Quick actions**: Varies by cheating method
- **Grade clustering**: Similar wrong answers among groups

### 3. Model Performance (Test Set)
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Random Forest | 98.33% | 0.99 | 0.97 |
| SVM | 98.33% | 0.99 | 0.97 |
| Neural Network | 97.50% | 0.98 | 0.95 |
| Ensemble | 96.67% | 0.97 | 0.94 |
