# Map of Key Result Files

When writing Bab 4 (Evaluasi dan Analisis), refer to these files as the source of truth.

## Performance Metrics & Comparison
- **File:** `results_comparison_800_vs_90.md` & `results/report_*.txt`
- **Content:** Quantitative evidence of model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1). Shows the superiority of the 800-sample model over the 90-sample model.

## Feature & Behavior Analysis
- **File:** `results/feature_importance_Random Forest.png`
- **Content:** A bar plot showing the most influential features for detecting cheating.
- **File:** `detection_results/cheater_vs_normal_comparison.png`
- **Content:** Visual comparison of aggregate behavior between detected cheaters and normal users.

## Case Studies (Studi Kasus)
- **Files:** `detection_results/offender_analysis_user_*.png`
- **Content:** Individual evidence plots for specific users flagged as suspicious. Use these as examples in the qualitative analysis section.

## Data & Models
- **File:** `data/processed_artificial_features_V2.csv` - The final dataset used for training.
- **File:** `results/model_Random Forest.joblib` - The final, saved, best-performing model.
- **File:** `FINAL_SUMMARY_800_SAMPLES.md` - High-level summary of the final experiment.
