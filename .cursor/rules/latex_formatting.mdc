- **Narrative Style:** Transform overly technical content into a more understandable style to make findings accessible to a broader audience.

- **Intuitive Flow:** Structure your thesis to ensure readers can easily follow the research journey.

- **Clear Terminology:** Avoid jargon where possible and define necessary technical terms clearly.


- **Figures:** To insert a figure, use the following structure. Place image files in the `newfigures/` directory.
    ```latex
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{newfigures/figure_filename.pdf}
        \caption{Caption explaining the figure.}
        \label{fig:label_for_figure}
    \end{figure}
    ```
- **Tables:** For tables generated from code (as CSVs), convert them to `.tex` files and place them in a `tables/` directory. Input them using:
    ```latex
    \begin{table}[h!]
        \centering
        \caption{Caption explaining the table.}
        \label{tab:label_for_table}
        \input{tables/table_filename.tex}
    \end{table}
    ```

- **Citations:** When making a claim that requires a source from the literature review, use a placeholder for easy searching later.

- **Code Snippets:** Use the `lstlisting` environment for displaying code.
