- You might want to use python script when creating intuitive figures.
you never need to remove the graph generator script! just make sure the script name is self explanatory
- When adding figures, always add to draft-skripsi-tex/newfigures/
- Always prefer PDF over other image formats for figures
- Clearly distinguish between real and synthetic data in visualizations
- Ensure all figures are labeled and described accurately
- Maintain consistency in figure styles and colors across the document
